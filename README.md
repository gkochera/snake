# Snake

![Example of Gameplay](./snake/example.gif)

This is a small project that I am constantly working on to get familiar with C#. It's a small clone of the classic arcade game **Snake**.

# Building

Clone the repository to your local machine and open the Visual Studio project file. From there, you can build the project and run the executable.

# How to Play

The arrow keys control the snake around the board.

- `Q` is used to Quit
- `P` is used to Pause
- `N` is used to start a New game

# Outstanding Issues With the Game

- Score bar works but needs to look more refined
