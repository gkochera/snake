# Snake

!(Example of Gameplay)[./example.gif]

This is a small project that I am constantly working on to get familiar with C#. It's a small clone of the classic arcade game **Snake**.

# Building

Clone the repository to your local machine and open the Visual Studio project file. From there, you can build the project and run the executable.

# How to Play

The arrow keys control the snake around the board. The `Q` key can be used to quit the game and the `P` key can be used to pause the game.
